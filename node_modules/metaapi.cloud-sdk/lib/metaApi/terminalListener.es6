/**
 * Defines interface for a terminal listener class. You can extend your trading application implementation from
 * this class.
 * Unlike low-level SynchronizationListener, when you use TerminalListener, the SDK will remove race conditions and most
 * events duplicates present on the transport layer. There is also a warranty that TeminalListener listener methods
 * will be invoked in sequence. No new event will be delivered until previous event have finished processing.
 * So that it is much easier to create trading applicaitions using TerminalListener, especially if the application is a
 * complex one.
 * Please note that some event listener methods can still receive event duplicates, so that they must be idempotent.
 * The terminal lifecycle starts with onConnected event, followed by initial synchronization, followed by data updates.
 * During initial synchronization the SDK will invoke the following methods in sequence: onSynchronizationStarted,
 * onSymbolSpecificationUpdated (invoked both for new and updated symbol specifications, can be skipped if
 * specifications data has not changed), onSymbolSpecificationRemoved, onQuote, onAccountInformationUpdated,
 * onPositionsReplaced (can be skipped if position data has not changed), onPositionsSynchronized,
 * onPendingOrdersReplaced (can be skipped if pending order data has not changed), onPendingOrdersSynchronized,
 * onHistoryOrderAdded, onHistoryOrdersSynchronized, onDealAdded, onDealsSynchronized.
 * Data update events are onPositionUpdated (invoked both for new and updated positions), onPositionRemoved,
 * onPendingOrderUpdated (invoked both for new and updated pending orders), onPendingOrderCompleted,
 * onHistoryOrderAdded, onDealAdded, onSymbolSpecificationUpdated (invoked both for new and updated symbol
 * specifications), onSymbolSpecificationRemoved, onQuote, onCandle, onTick, onBook.
 * There are also status events available such as onBrokerConnectionStatus, onDisconnected,
 * onSubscriptionDowngraded.
